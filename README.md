# DLD-Class-Project
A DES Cracker
This project is for my Digital Logic Design class. 
The project is a DES cracker. It is written in SystemVerilog to be implmented onto an FPGA. Most of the code was provided by my professor, Dr. Stine.
The code iterates through potential keys, generated by running a counter through parity generation, through a DES module with a given plaintext and comparing
the resulting ciphertext with a given ciphertext. It does so until the ciphertexts match at which point it will store the potential key used to generate the correct
ciphertext and returns to an Idle state.
